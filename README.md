## Features

- **Input Animations**: Labels move when the input fields are focused or filled, providing a smooth user experience.
- **Hover Effects**: The submit button has a hover effect that adds a gradient background.
- **Mobile-Friendly**: The form is optimized for mobile devices with media queries for smaller screens.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the form.
- **CSS**: For styling the form and adding animations.
